/*Q4*/

int main(int argc,char * argv[])
{
	char *p = argv[0];
	for (;*p!='\0';*p++)
	{
		char &ref=*p;
		cout<<*p;
	}
	return 0;
}

//anwsers for Q4:
1.A pointer can be re-assigned any number of times while a reference can not be re-seated after binding. 
2.Pointers can point nowhere (NULL), whereas reference always refer to an object.
3.You can't take the address of a reference like you can with pointers.
4.There's no "reference arithmetics" (but you can take the address of an object pointed by a reference and do pointer arithmetics on it as in &obj + 5).

Explaination for when trying to use a reference in C++ the way as in Q3:
1. Apointer can be re-assigned any number of times while a reference can not be re-seated after binding.//
